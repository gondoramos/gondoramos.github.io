{"name":"Rick Ramos","tagline":"An Introduction To The Life & Times of Rick Ramos","body":"The stories have been told with only a modicum of truth.  The women, the drinking, friendships severed and lost.  The facts are much more frightening.  Born to a family of half-crazed 3rd generation Mexican-Americans, Rick Ramos never had a chance.  Growing up with a loving, caring mother means very little when your father is a thirty-five year veteran of the United States Postal Service (some say he’s practically all heart), but through it all Ramos fought to establish himself as his own man.  Standing in the shadow of the “Greatest Asshole the World Has Ever Known”, Ramos knew that it was vital to forge his own way in the world.  \r\n \r\nAfter years of studying the greats - Sam Kinison, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, Paul Mooney, and Richard Pryor - Ramos saw the writing on the wall and dove headfirst into the world of stand-up comedy.  After swimming in the sea of shit that is Los Angeles, Ramos finally broke through the Hollywood comedy scene, working regularly at the Hollywood Improv, The Laugh Factory, and The Comedy Store.  In 2006 he taped a segment for the Payaso Comedy Slam which later aired on both the Showtime Network and Comedy Central to great acclaim.  \r\n \r\nRamos is currently expanding his talents to include acting - studying at The Actor’s Menu Workshop with Bill Howey.  It’s a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, but Ramos knows that there is no success without struggle.  In the immortal words of his literary hero Charles Bukowski,\r\n \r\n “What matters most is how well you walk through the fire.”\r\n \r\nDAMN RIGHT!
